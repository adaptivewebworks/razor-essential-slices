# Razor Essential Slices
This library is ported from https://github.com/prismicio/vue-essential-slices. It aims to replicate the components for use in .NET Core projects

A set of responsive, accessible, and customizable website sections (think Hero, Faq...),
connected to a ([Prismic.io](https://prismic.io)) backend. You most probably want to use this with [SliceMachine](https://slicemachine.dev), eventually!
